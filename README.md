11/11 UPDATE

My latest code is working and posted.  
The strategy design is present and the display works for the Vertical and Snake sail although the movement needs some work. The chaseSail(observable) displays but doesn't move towards the cc ship.   
The factory design is implemented with the PirateFactory. 

**Issues:**
- Additional boundaries still need to be set. We can discuss this later.
- Chase sail strategy doesn't move
- implement singleton map

Also, Caylah, you can follow the code I used for the SnakeSail as it is now paired with whats in the pirate class to make the monsters/sharks move back and forth. I can help you with this if its not clear.

Here's a link that may help with working through Eclipse.
